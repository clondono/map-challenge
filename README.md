# Breeze Engineering Coding Challenge
Use the data sets provided in /data to create a unique experience using any mapping API you prefer. Be creative with the usage of the data to highlight it's usability within a mapping environment.  You may use any language you prefer to complete this challenge.

There are three sets of data included:

`users.csv` - A list of 20 users from a theoretical system with basic information about the user.  
`transactions.csv` - A list of financial transactions for all of the users in `users.csv`.  
`locations.csv` - A list of geographic locations of users during a given time using latitide and longitude

## Requirements
- Must be built using a modern backend infrastructure:
  - Ruby on Rails
  - Node.js
- Must repurpose the datasets using a modern data storage mechanism:
  - PostgreSQL
  - Redis
- Must use a modern map API to proide in-browser map rendering:
  - Google Maps (https://developers.google.com/maps/)
  - Bing (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg427610.aspx)
  - OpenStreetMap (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API)
- Must utilize every dataset to show coorelation between the data
- Must provide one or more interactions with your map to show the data being computed dynamically
- Must create a usable interface to interact with your app from a browser
- Must deploy your app to a publicly accessible URL
- Must present your documented source code in GitHub repository

## Extra Credit
Bonus points rewarded for:
- Exemplary demonstration of user interface design capability
- Well documented code
- Apps backed by Ruby on Rails
- Apps integrating modern UI/UX frameworks:
  - AngularJS
  - EmberJS
  - Jekyll
- Fun bells and whistles!
